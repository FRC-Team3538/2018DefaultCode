In General use the Right Hand Rule:
* Positive command is Forward motion
* X is forward, Y is left, and Z is up.
* Positive rotation is counter clockwise


To Drive the robot forward: 
Lmotor = 1
Rmotor = 1

To turn the robot clockwise (Negative Rotation):
Lmotor = 1
Rmotor = -1

To turn the robot counterclockwise (Positive Rotation): 
Lmotor = -1
Rmotor = 1

[right motor is inverted in RobotMap]


Elevator convention: 
When raising the elevator: 
ElevatorMotor1 = 1
ElevatorMotor2 = 1
ElevatorEncoder = Increasing in a positive direction

When lowering the elevator: 
ElevatorMotor1 = -1
ElevatorMotor2 = -1
ElevatorEncoder = Decreasing in a negative direction until 0

[ElevatorMotor1 is inverted in RobotMap]



Wrist convention: 
When looking at the side of the elevator with the wrist mounted
Counter-Clockwise Rotation = -1
Encoder = Decreasing

Clockwise Rotation:
WristMotor = 1
Encoder = Increasing


Claw Convention: 
Intake Motors Intaking: = 1
Intake Motors Ejecting: = -1

Claw Close     = forward
Claw Compliant = off
Claw Open      = reverse
